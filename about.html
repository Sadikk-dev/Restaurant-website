                <h3><span>el sabah</span> restaurant</h3>
                <p>
                    it all started in a tiny kitchen with a big dream.
                    back in 2012, two childhood friends, Maya and Luca, found themselves reminiscing over homemade pasta and late-night cooking experiments. They shared a passion for food that told stories—meals that reminded you of home, of travels, of laughter echoing across dinner tables.
                    with nothing but a secondhand oven, a notebook full of family recipes, and an idea scribbled on a napkin, they opened the doors to a modest 10-table spot in the corner of the city. It wasn’t fancy, but it was honest. And people noticed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    word spread quickly: the pasta was handmade every morning, the sauces simmered for hours, and every plate came with a story. Soon, what began as a neighborhood secret became a beloved destination for anyone craving food made with soul.
                </p>
                <p>
                    today, our restaurant still holds tight to those roots. Whether you’re here for a quick lunch or a long dinner with friends, we want you to feel like you’ve been welcomed into our home. Because for us, food isn’t just about flavor—it’s about connection.
                    thanks for being part of our journey. We’re glad you’re here.
